<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewmilson.incognitobrightnesscontrol" target="_blank"><h4>Incognito Brightness Control</h4></a>
<p>Incognito Brightness Control is an Android app I made so my parents do not catch me on my phone at night. I have plans in the future to use my Arduino as a sensor connected to my phone so it can detect when there is activity outside my room and automatically turn off my screen!</p>

<a href="https://mytimetab.com" target="_blank"><h4>Time Tab</h4></a>
<p>This was the first web app I made. I was 15 at the time. I learnt a heck of a lot in the process. One of the things I learnt was how much I hate making and adding Privacy Policies, Terms Of Conditions and all that related jazz.</p>
