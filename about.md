Hi I am Andrew Milson! I am currently living in New Zealand although I lived in Sydney Australia for the first 11 years of my life. It is a pretty cool (literally in the winter) country, really love it.

I am 16 years old and a high school student. I earn money by mowing lawn for my gran with a hand mower. I actually really enjoy doing it. When I am doing the mowing I put on music, get in the zone, lose touch and just enjoy!

My true passion lies in having fun with code (programming) and being an entrepreneur. It has become a healthy addiction. I also love spending my days by longboarding, scootering round the house, playing social soccer with the lads, playing in Orchestra, Jazz Band, Brass Group and doing other exhilarating things. When programming I mainly do web development but I might make the occasional mobile app. I prefer front-end to back-end development but truly enjoy them both. I really like the idea of building startups in Silicon Valley. This will hopefully be a very real future after I convince my parents I have a plan in place. I am not a fan of the learning part of school. I find being fed information that I am not passionate about makes learning difficult and prefer the approach of seeking the very best information I am most passionate about instead.
