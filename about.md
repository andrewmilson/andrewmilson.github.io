Hi I am Andrew Milson! I am currently living in New Zealand. It is a pretty cool (literally) country, really love it. I am 16 years old and a high school student. I earn money by mowing lawn for my gran with a hand mower. I actually really enjoy doing it. When I am doing the mowing I put on music, get in the zone, lose touch and just enjoy!

I enjoy spending my days programming and longboarding. I mainly do web development but I might make the occasional mobile app. I prefer front-end to back-end development. I am a little confused what I want to do with my future. I really like the idea of working in Silicon Valley!
