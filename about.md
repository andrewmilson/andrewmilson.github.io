Hi I am Andrew Milson! I am currently living in New Zealand although I lived in Sydney Australia for the first 11 years of my life. It is a pretty cool (literally in the winter) country, really love it. I am 16 years old and a high school student. I earn money by mowing lawn for my gran with a hand mower. I actually really enjoy doing it. When I am doing the mowing I put on music, get in the zone, lose touch and just enjoy!

My true passion lies in doing programming and being an entrepreneur. I would even say that it is a mild addiction. I also love spending my days by longboarding, scootering, playing social soccer with the lads, playing in Orchestra the Jazz Band, Brass Group and doing other exhilarating things. I mainly do web development but I might make the occasional mobile app. I prefer front-end to back-end development but truly enjoy them both. I am a little confused what I want to do with my future as I really like the idea of working on building startups in Silicon Valley. This will hopefully be a very real future after I convince my parents I have a plan in place. I am not a fan of the learning part of school. I find being fed information that I am not passionate about makes learning extremly difficult and I much prefer the approach of seeking the very best information I am most passionate about instead.
