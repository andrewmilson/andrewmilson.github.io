Hi I am Andrew! I'm pretty chill. I am currently hanging out in New Zealand. It is a sick country, really love it, heaps to offer. I am 16 years old and a student. I earn money by mowing massive amounts of lawn for my gran with a hand mower. I actually really enjoy doing it. When I am doing the mowing I put on music, get in the zone, lose touch with the real world and then enter "hermit mode" a mode where I am neither awake or asleep.

I enjoy spending my days programming and longboarding. I mainly do web development but I might make the occasional mobile app. I prefer front-end to  In the future I hope to do computer science at university and then get a job at some swagger company in the silicon valley. Google here I come!!!
