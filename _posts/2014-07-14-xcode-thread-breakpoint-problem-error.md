title: Xcode thread 1 breakpoint 1.1 problem
tags: Xcode

Extremely recently I started IOS development and followed some tutorials to get up to scratch. When I was following these I kept of getting errors like `Thread 1: breakpoint 1.1` and it was infuriating me as I was copying the tutorials word for word and had no idea why this problem was happening. I tried finding out what I was doing wrong by doing some web searches but could not seem to find a solution.

I really hope this fixes it for you. I just came across the solution due to randomly pressing and deleting things. Any non-beginner IOS developer will probably see how much of a rookie mistake this is.
